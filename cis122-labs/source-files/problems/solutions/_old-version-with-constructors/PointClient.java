This client program uses Point objects.
Expected output:

p1 is (8, 2)
p2 is (4, 3)
p1's distance from origin = 8.246211251235321
p1 is now (9, 4)
p2 is now (3, 13)
*/

public class PointClient {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// construct two Point objects, one at (8, 2) and one at (4, 3)

		// display the two Point objects' state
		System.out.println("p1 is ...");
		System.out.println("p2 is ...");

		// display p1 distance from origin
		System.out.println("p1's distance from origin is ...");

		// translate p1 to (9, 4)
		// translate p2 to (3, 13)

		// display the two Point objects' state again
		System.out.println("p1 is ...");
		System.out.println("p2 is ...");
